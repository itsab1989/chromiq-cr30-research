"""Transport abstraction for the CR30 reference implementation.

The point of this module is a boundary: **nothing below `Transport` knows the
protocol, and nothing above it knows the operating system.** `frame.py` and
`identity.py` never import `serial`, never enumerate devices and never see a
port name, so the decoder is testable from recorded captures on a machine that
has never had a CR30 attached (CLAUDE.md 14).

Three implementations:

* `SerialTransport` -- USB serial, today's working path.
* `ReplayTransport` -- feeds frames from a recorded capture. No hardware.
  This is what makes CI and contributor work possible.
* `BleTransport`    -- deliberately absent. When BLE is characterised it becomes
  a fourth file implementing this same three-method interface; see
  TRANSPORT_BLE.md. Nothing above `Transport` should need to change.

Transport rules encoded here, and where each comes from:

* **A frame must be written in exactly ONE `write()` call.** VERIFIED,
  `EXP-USB-005c`: a 60-byte frame split as 30+30, 59+1, 1+59 or 20+20+20
  produced **no reply at all**, five times out of five, while the same bytes in
  one write always replied. This is the single most portability-critical rule
  in the transport.
* **Never write more than one frame per call.** VERIFIED, `EXP-USB-005b`:
  120 and 180 bytes in one write produced no reply. The device recovers on the
  next single-frame write with no port reopen.
* **No settling delay is needed after opening the port.** VERIFIED,
  `EXP-USB-005`: 10/10 valid replies with a 0 ms delay, identical to 300 ms.
  The 300 ms in the session-1 probe was untested superstition.
* **No inter-command delay is needed.** VERIFIED, `EXP-USB-005`: 30/30 valid
  replies at a 0 ms gap.
* **Baud rate and line coding are ignored.** VERIFIED, `EXP-USB-005`: identical
  replies at 300 / 115200 / 1000000 baud and at 8N1 / 7E1 / 8N2 / 7N1 / 8O1 --
  and a 60-byte reply completes in ~0.77 ms, which is faster than 60 bytes can
  physically cross a 115200-baud line (5.2 ms). No UART is in the path.
